As many of you might know, Meetup.com is great to organise your meetup but not so much to keep details about talks, speakers or sponsors. That's one of the main reason Milos, Peter and I have decided that perhaps having a website it will help.

What can you expect to find in this website? we will keep using [Meetup.com](https://meetup.com) for the meetup organisation, but we will be adding events, articvles and whatever we think is valuable for the Kubernetes London community. Suggestions are always welcome!

Techie details, this website is created using *Hugo* and yes, it runs in kubernetes (1.6.4 at the time of writing this post).
