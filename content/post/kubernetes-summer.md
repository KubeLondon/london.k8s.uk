London Kubernauts, 

The summer is here and we figured why not throw a Meetup before we all head to the beaches!

We will kick off the night with a talk given by [Charlotte Godley](https://twitter.com/charwarz), Platform Automation Engineer at [Ocado](https://www.ocado.com). Charlotte will talk about deployment pipelines for Kubernetes using Gitlab CI, what checks you can use to catch human error early, and ways of validating that changes won’t cause problems later and many many other things.

After that we will move to the next talk given by the one and only <drum rolls> [Tim Hockin](https://twitter.com/thockin),  Principal SW Engineer, Kubernetes & Google Container Engine, Google. Time will give a talk about Kubernetes networking, a topic which a lot of people tend to struggle with. Who else could shed more light on this than the man directly involved in the project straight from the start? :-)

This Meetup would never happen without our wonderful sponsors. [Skills Matter](https://skillsmatter.com/) have kindly provided us with their excellent venue.

Our friends from [Jetstack](https://www.jetstack.io/), Kubernetes specialists based in London, will feed us before we head to the main room for the talks! <applause placeholder>. If you're looking into running Kubernetes in production you should definitely talk to Jetstack. They are quickly becoming the go-to experts in this space  So, do check their site and get in touch with them!

## Program: 

6:30 - 7:00 Drinks, pizza and socializing 

7:00 - 7:30  Charlotte Godley, Deployment pipelines with Kubernetes 

How do you make the process of getting code into production seamless as a developer, without causing difficulties for operations? Developers would rather avoid gatekeeping in order to have shorter feedback loops. Ops teams would rather be prepared for what's going into production and when, in order to avoid surprises and prepare support training. In this talk you will learn about the process of creating a deployment pipeline for Kubernetes using Gitlab CI, what checks you can use to catch human error early, and ways of validating that changes won’t cause problems later. This talk will improve your ability to design deployment processes which avoid developer pain but build operational trust.

7:30 - 7:40 Q&A and short break 

8:00 - 9:00 Tim Hockin, Deep-dive on Kubernetes networking 

Kubernetes networking can feel a bit overwhelming for some people. In this talk Tim will walk us from the basics to the more advanced topics in Kubernetes networking. Time will explain some of the design decision which drove the networking architecture and much more.

after 9:00PM: PUB

## SPEAKER BIOS: 

**Charlotte Godley,** 

Charlotte is a Platform Automation Engineer working on Kubernetes platform at Ocado Technology. Previously she has worked as a developer in industries lacking great processes and deployment strategies. Drawing on her experiences, in her current role she relishes the opportunity to destroy roadblocks for future developers whilst writing services for ops teams to monitor the platform's response. As a developer in her own time, she writes a blog on side projects and particular quirks of different technologies. Her aim is to make it easier for the next person with the same problem, and as a result her blog posts have been helpful to beginners and experienced programmers alike.


**Tim Hockin**

Tim is a Principal SW Engineer, Kubernetes & Google Container Engine, Google 
Tim was one of the founding members of the Kubernetes project, and has overseen large parts of the system, including storage and networking. Before Kubernetes, he worked on Google's Borg and Omega systems, and was responsible for most of the node-side functionality. Before that he fiddled with the BIOS, OS, and other
